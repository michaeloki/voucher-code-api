## Description
Write a program in Typescript using OOP to run on NodeJS, which when run would generate a list of token/voucher codes
based on a type of voucher specified in a configuration. Configuration must be provided as a separate file in any
format of your choice.

The config file is in JSON and the two "algorithms" are "sequentialumbers" and "complexvouchers".

The strategy design pattern was used to design this API.
